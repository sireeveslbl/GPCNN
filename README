This is an experimental github for Steven Reeves's PhD research for the University of California, Santa Cruz, utilizing 
Gaussian Process Modeling and Convolutional Neural Networks for Single Image Super Resolution. 

This model uses a Gaussian Process convolution upsampling algorthim paired to an deep CNN enhancement network based off of ResNET.
